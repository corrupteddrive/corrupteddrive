This account is just for browsing and creating issues on repos and stuff like that. For my own code and repositories, you can find them on my [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/corrupted), which is open-source unlike GitHub (ironic ik). Keep in mind I don't code much so don't expect anything more than a couple dotfiles.
